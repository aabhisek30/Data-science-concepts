## Implement Data smoothing and Data Transformation techniques without using library

1. Dataset used - Zomato Dataset (from - https://www.kaggle.com/ronidas39/zomato-india-data-set)
2. Carried out following techniques on price column
3. Data smoothing - Binning by mean, median and boundary
4. Data Transformation - Z score and Min Max transformation
 

## Handling Missing values

1. Dataset used - Titanic Dataset (from - https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
2. 3 columns ( 2 categorical - Cabin,Embarked and 1 numerical - Age) have missing value
3. Used 4 different approach to handle missing value and compared their performance using SVM
